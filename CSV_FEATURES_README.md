## New Features Implemented

### 1. CSV-Based Voter Registration
- **Admin can upload CSV files** with voter data during election creation

### 2. Voter Authentication System
- **Unique ID authentication** - voters enter their unique ID to verify eligibility
- **Self-service voting** - no manual admin approval needed

- **Wallet validation** - ensures only registered wallets can vote

### 3. Enhanced Admin Interface
- **Voter database status** - shows total voters and finalization status

## CSV File Format

Create a CSV file with exactly these columns:
```csv

John Doe,STU001,0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6
Jane Smith,STU002,0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c22C23cde
```

### Requirements:
- **name**: Voter's full name
- **unique_id**: Unique identifier (student ID, employee ID, etc.)
- **wallet_id**: Valid Ethereum wallet address (0x...)

## Sample Files

- `sample_voters.csv` - Example CSV file with 5 test voters
- Use these wallet addresses for testing with MetaMask

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Changes:
